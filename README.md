CLUB-HIVE
The idea is to create a web application where you can:

- See all campus events in one place: Browse upcoming activities, filter by interests, and participate with a single click.
- Connect with clubs and friends: Join club discussions, chat with members, and stay updated on club activities.
- Access a shared library: Share class notes, textbooks, and study guides with classmates, making collaboration a breeze.

ClubHive is all about creating a more connected and efficient campus life. It is built on a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure, ensuring the app is always available and reliable for you.

**My task was to create a chat web app with the following features:**

- Direct chat functionality
- Group chat functionality
- Sending text, emoji, photo, file and video messages
- Message deletion functionality
- Video calling functionality
- Delete feature (delete for you, delete for all)
